## Story
It's a very warm day without water right now...

I'm traveling through western deserts, trying not to die.

Sometimes I wish to die.

Maybe death is better then we think it is, who knows.

Wait, what is that!? I saw a black book on the ground in the sand.

I need to see what it is.

It's blank, but there is a text that says "Write a name of someone with this pencil and that person will be in a better place. Help somebody."

It sounds interesting, but not realistic...

After hours of walking I have come near some rich village.

Let's try this!
